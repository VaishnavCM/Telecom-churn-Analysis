## 📈 Business Insights from the Dashboard

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 New Customers Have High Churn

The highest churn rate is seen in customers with 0–12 months tenure, especially the first 1–3 months.

Indicates poor onboarding or early dissatisfaction.


### 💸 Monthly Charge Drives Churn

Churn rate is:

20% for customers charged $0–$25

>70% for customers charged $75–$100

76% for customers charged over $100


Suggests customers with higher bills are more likely to leave.


### 🌐 Internet Service Matters

Fiber optic users have the highest churn rate (~41.9%).

DSL users show better retention.


### 🧾 Payment Method Insight

Electronic Check users have a churn rate of 45.3%, the highest among all methods.

Automatic payment methods like Credit Card or Bank Transfer have lower churn.


### 📝 Contract Type Insight

Month-to-Month contracts show a churn rate of 51%

One-Year: ~11% churn

## Observation:

From the dashboard analysis, it is evident that the highest churn rate is among new members (those with a tenure of 0–12 months). This group shows a significant portion of overall churn.

Additionally, when analyzing churn by monthly charges, customers paying between ₹75–₹100 and above ₹100 experience churn rates above 70%, while customers with lower monthly charges (₹0–₹25) have a much lower churn rate of only 20%.

Looking deeper into service preferences, new members using Fiber Optic Internet service show a notably high churn rate. Similarly, customers who use Electronic Check as their payment method are also more likely to churn.

Lastly, the churn rate is highest among customers on Month-to-Month contracts, with 51% churn, which is significantly higher compared to those on One-Year contracts.
